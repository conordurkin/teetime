Four reasons I did this project:
1. First time building a python program.
2. First time building a webscraping tool.
3. First time building something to interact with the 'real world' (e.g. sending me an email)
4. I'd like to play Muirfield Links next year, but they're booked on the day I'll be there.

This app will:
- Check Muirfield's website for a particular day, and see whether any tee times have opened up.
- If yes, it'll email me to let me know! And send a text too.
- If no, it'll do nothing.

It'll repeat that every 5 minutes until I tell it to stop.
Once a week, it'll send me an email letting me know it's still running.
